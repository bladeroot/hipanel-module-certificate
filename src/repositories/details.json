Intellectual Property Rights. \r\n\r\n4.1. Comodo IP Rights.

Indemnification.\r\n\r\n5.1. Indemnification.  Subscriber shall indemnify Comodo and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each an \"Indemnified Person\") against all liabilities, losses, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) (collectively \"Losses\") that, directly or indirectly, are based on Subscriber's breach of this agreement, information provided by Subscriber, or Subscriber's or its customers' infringement on the rights of a third party. \r\n5.2. Indemnification Procedure.  Comodo shall notify Subscriber promptly of any demand for indemnification.  However, Comodo's failure to notify will not relieve Subscriber from its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the failure to provide timely notice materially prejudices Subscriber.  Subscriber may assume the defense of any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to an indemnification obligation unless assuming the defense would result in potential conflicting interests as determined by the Indemnified Person in good faith.  Subscriber may not settle any claim, action, suit or proceeding related to this agreement unless the settlement also includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from liability. \r\n5.3. Additional Liability. The indemnification obligations of Subscriber are not Comodo's sole remedy for Subscriber's breach and are in addition to any other remedies Comodo may have against Subscriber under this agreement.  Subscriber's indemnification obligations survive the termination of this agreement. \r\n\r\n6. Term and Termination.\r\n\r\n6.1. Term.  Unless otherwise terminated as allowed herein, this agreement is effective upon Subscriber's acceptance and lasts for as long as a Certificate issued under the agreement is valid.   \r\n6.2. Termination.  Either party may terminate the agreement with 20 business days notice for convenience.  Comodo may terminate this agreement immediately without notice if\r\n\t(i) Subscriber materially breaches this agreement,\r\n\t(ii) if Comodo revokes a Certificate as allowed herein, \r\n\t(iii) if Comodo rejects Subscriber's Certificate application, \r\n\t(iv) Comodo cannot satisfactorily validate Subscriber in accordance with section 1.1, or \r\n\t(v) if industry standards change in a way that affects the validity of the Certificates ordered by Subscriber. \r\n6.3. Events Upon Termination.  After termination, Comodo may revoke any other Certificate's issued to Subscriber without further notice.  Subscriber shall pay any amounts still owed for the Certificates.  Comodo is not obligated to refund any payment made by Subscriber upon termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n7.1. Relying Party Warranties.  Subscriber acknowledges that the Relying Party Warranty is only for the benefit of Relying Parties.  Subscriber does not have rights under the warranty, including any right to enforce the terms of the warranty or make a claim under the warranty. \r\n7.2. Exclusion of Warranties.   THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\".   COMODO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED AND EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THE SERVICES.

THIS WAIVER INCLUDES ALL DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, USE, OR DATA AND APPLIES EVEN IF COMODO IS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  These limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by law regardless of 1) the reason for or nature of the liability, including tort claims, 2) the number of any claims, 3) the extent or nature of the damages, and 4) whether any other provisions of this agreement have been breached or proven ineffective.\r\n7.4. Exception.  Nothing in this agreement excludes or limits the liability of either party for death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of that party or for any statements made fraudulently by either party. \r\n\r\n8. Remedy.\r\n\r\n8.1. Injunctive Relief.  Subscriber acknowledges that its breach of this agreement will result in irreparable harm to Comodo that cannot adequately be redressed by compensatory damages.  Accordingly, in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available, Comodo may seek and obtain an injunctive order against a breach or threatened breach of the agreement by Subscriber. \r\n8.2. Limitation on Actions. Except for actions and claims related to a party's indemnification and confidentiality obligations, all claims and actions arising from this agreement must be brought within one (1) year from the date when the cause of action occurred.  \r\n8.3.

Confidentiality.  Except as allowed herein, a party (\"Receiving Party\") shall not use or disclose any Confidential Information provided by the other party (the \"Disclosing Party\") other than for the purpose of performing its obligations under this agreement.  The Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure and shall ensure that any person receiving Confidential Information complies with the restrictions in this section.  The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information if the information: \r\n\r\n\t(i)is already possessed by the Receiving Party before receipt from the Disclosing Party;\r\n\t(ii)is or becomes public domain without fault of the Receiving Party; \r\n\t(iii)is received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not under an obligation of confidentiality or a restriction on the use and disclosure of the information,\r\n\t(iv)is disclosed in response to the requirements of a law, governmental order, regulation, or legal process and the Receiving Party first gives prior notice to the Disclosing Party of the requirement to disclose the information, or\r\n\t(v)is disclosed under operation of law to the public without a duty of confidentiality.\r\nA party asserting one of the exceptions to Confidential Information above shall prove the assertion using verifiable documentary evidence.  The restrictions contained in this section apply for the duration of the agreement plus five years after its termination.\r\n\r\n10. Privacy. \r\n\r\n\t(i) Comodo shall follow the privacy policy posted on its website when receiving and using information from the Subscriber.  Comodo may amend the privacy policy at any time by posting the amended privacy policy on its website.  Subject to Section 10(ii), Comodo shall use reasonable efforts in protecting Subscriber's information.  Subscriber acknowledges that risks remain that are beyond Comodo's reasonable control and waives all liability of Comodo for these risks.   \r\n\t(ii) Subscriber consents to 1) Comodo disclosing Subscriber's information publicly by embedding the information in issued Certificates and 2) Comodo disclosing and transferring Subscriber's information to third parties located outside of the European Union as necessary to validate and issue Certificates. \r\n\t(iii) Subscriber may opt-out of having information used for purposes not directly related to the Services by emailing a clear notice to optout@comodo.com.

Other than for payment obligations by Subscriber, neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform an obligation to the extent that the delay or failure is caused by an occurrence beyond the party's reasonable control. Each party acknowledges that the operation of the Internet is beyond the other party's reasonable control, and neither party will be liable for a delay or failure caused by an interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, Internet slow-downs or failures, or other such transmission failure.  \r\n11.2.

Subscriber shall periodically review the Repository to be aware of any changes.  Subscriber may terminate the agreement if Subscriber does not agree to the amendment.  Subscriber's continued use of the Services after an amendment is posted constitutes Subscriber's acceptance of the amendment.\r\n11.5. Waiver.  A party's failure to enforce a provision of this agreement will not waive the party's right to enforce the same provision later or right to enforce any other provision of this agreement.  To be effective, all waivers must be both in writing and signed by the party benefiting form the waived provision.  \r\n11.6. Assignment.
